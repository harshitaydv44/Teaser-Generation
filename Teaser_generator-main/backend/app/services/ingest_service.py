"""Fetching a source video from a URL.

Upload was the only way in, which meant a two-hour conference talk had to be
downloaded to a laptop and pushed back up again. This pulls it directly.

Two things make this different from an upload, and both shape the code below.

The first is time: a long video takes minutes, far longer than a request should
hold open. So the row is created immediately in `fetching` and the bytes arrive
in a background task, exactly as generation jobs already work -- the frontend
polls the video until it leaves that state.

The second is trust. An upload is bytes the user already had; a URL is an
instruction to *this server* to make a request. That is a server-side request
forgery primitive unless it is bounded, and it is bounded in two places:
`assert_fetchable` below rejects an obviously unusable URL up front, and
net_guard confines every connection the download actually opens. The second is
the one that matters -- see that module for why checking the submitted string
is not enough on its own.
