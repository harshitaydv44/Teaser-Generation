"""yt-dlp, wrapped so the rest of the app never sees it.

Everything yt-dlp-shaped is confined here: option construction, its exception
types, and the fact that it writes files itself rather than handing back a
stream. Callers get a `DownloadResult` or an `AppError`.

The options below are deliberately restrictive. yt-dlp is a large surface aimed
at interactive use, and several of its defaults are wrong for a server that is
handed URLs by strangers -- it will happily follow a playlist to a thousand
videos, run an arbitrary post-processor, or read a user's cookie jar. Each is
turned off explicitly rather than trusted to stay off.
